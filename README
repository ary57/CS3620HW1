Each problem is in its own .c file. 
    problem 1: p1.c
    problem2 : p2.c
    problem3a: p3V.c
    problem3b: p3R.c
    problem4 : p4.c

    p1.c, p2.c and p4.c all require inputs from the command line. 
        p1.c and p2.c take in an integer and will print out their results
        p4.c will take in a string which is the input .csv file and will create a new output file called "problem4Result.csv"
